This is a simple program that creates a dictionary and then calls values using a set of predefined keys. Simply run the module and the program will print a hidden message.

The first bit of code creates a dictionary using a for loop that pairs every item in a string with a numeric key. 

The second bit of code then looks at the the encrypted tuple and uses a for loop and an if statement to check if there is a corresponding key in the dictionary. It does this for every item in the tuple.
